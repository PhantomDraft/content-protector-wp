It allows you to restrict access to posts, pages, WooCommerce products, bbPress forums, as well as categories and tags. The plugin supports two protection modes:

- **Global Mode:**
  The entire site is protected using a specified global username and password.

- **Individual Mode:**
  Access is restricted for specific items (by ID, slug, or taxonomy) with the ability to set a separate password for each.

When a user attempts to access protected content, they are prompted to enter a password. Upon successful entry, a cookie is set to grant access.
